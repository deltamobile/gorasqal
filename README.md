gorasqal
========

Go bindings for the Rasqal RDF Query library.

This is a updated version of
[gorasqal](https://bitbucket.org/ww/goraqal)
 written by William Waites <ww@styx.org>.  We've done
a little bit of cleanup and testing with Go 1.1.1.
This library is not complete.

For basic usage, see [Documentation.txt](Documentation.txt).

Prerequisites
=============

Install the development libraries for Rasqal version 3.  On
Debian / Ubuntu run:

    sudo apt-get install librasqal3-dev

You will also need [goraptor](https://github.com/deltamobile/goraptor).
